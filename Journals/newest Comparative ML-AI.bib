	abstract = {Turtles are one of the ancient marine animals that live today. However, the population is threatened with extinction, so its existence needs to be protected and preserved because turtles often eat plastic waste in the ocean whose shape, texture, and color are similar to jellyfish. The technology in the computer vision area can be used to find the solution related to the case of reducing plastics and bottles trash in the ocean by implementing robotics. The region-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the latest image segmentation and has good detection accuracy based on the Faster R-CNN algorithm. In this study, the training image was built based on two different objects, namely plastic bottles and plastic bags. The target is that the two objects can be recognized even if there are other objects in the vicinity, or the image quality will be affected by the color of the seawater. The results obtained are that plastic objects and bottles can be recognized correctly in the picture. Of the five-color hues tested, the results show that the object detection process is valid on the average color hue, sepia, bandicoot, and grayscale. In contrast, the object detection process is invalid in black-and-white tones. The test results shown in the table explain that the object detection that gets the highest results is an image with normal coloring, while the lowest value is on bandicoot. The average accuracy of all types of images tested is 96.50. However, the accuracy value still needs to be improved to apply feasibility permanently to hardware such as diving robots.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, data-driven methods have gained great popularity in the industry, supported by state-of-the-art advancements in machine learning. These methods require a large quantity of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain and mostly costly and challenging. To address these challenges, researchers have turned their attention to unsupervised and few-shot learning methods, which produced encouraging results, particularly in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing. With the lack of pretrained models, time series feature learning is still considered as an open area of research. This paper presents an efficient two-stage feature learning approach for anomaly detection in machine processes, based on a prototype few-shot learning technique that requires a limited number of labeled samples. The work is evaluated on a real-world scenario using the publicly available CNC Machining dataset. The proposed method outperforms the conventional prototypical network and the feature analysis shows a high generalization ability achieving an F1-score of 90.3\%. The comparison with handcrafted features proves the robustness of the deep features and their invariance to data shifts across machines and time periods, which makes it a reliable method for sensory industrial applications.},

One of the issues that lead to serious concerns is human falls, especially among aged people. Computer vision techniques can be used to identify fall events, and Deep Learning methods can detect them with optimum accuracy. Such imaging-based solutions are a good alternative to body-worn solutions. This article proposes a novel human fall detection solution based on the Fast Pose Estimation method. The solution uses Time-Distributed Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (TD-CNN-LSTM) and 1Dimentional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) models, to classify the data extracted from image frames, and achieved high accuracies: 98 and 97\% for the 1D-CNN and TD-CNN-LSTM models, respectively. Therefore, by applying the Fast Pose Estimation method, which has not been used before for this purpose, the proposed solution is an effective contribution to accurate human fall detection, which can be deployed in edge devices due to its low computational and memory demands.},

The prediction accuracy and generalization ability of the framework was validated using experimental results. Images of pearl chain alignment at varying input voltages were used to build deep regression models using modified ML and CNN architectures that can correlate pearl chain alignment patterns of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast) cells and polystyrene microbeads to DEP force. Various ML models such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Linear Regression along with DL models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures of AlexNet, ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and GoogLeNet have been analyzed in order to build an effective regression framework to estimate the force induced on yeast cells and microbeads. The efficiencies of the models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Relative, Mean Squared Error, R-squared, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as evaluation metrics. ResNet-50 with RMSPROP gave the best performance, with a validation RMSE of 0.0918 on yeast cells while AlexNet with ADAM optimizer gave the best performance, with a validation RMSE of 0.1745 on microbeads. This provides a baseline for further studies in the application of deep learning in DEP aided Lab-on-Chip devices.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary: Many patient clinical characteristics, such as diagnosis dates, biomarker status, and therapies received, are only available as unstructured text in electronic health records. Obtaining this information for research purposes is a difficult and costly process, requiring trained clinical experts to manually review patient documents. Machine Learning techniques offer a promising solution for efficiently extracting clinically relevant information from unstructured text found in patient documents. However, the use of data produced with machine learning techniques for research purposes introduces unique challenges in assessing validity and generalizability to different cohorts of interest. To enable the effective and accurate use of such data for research purposes, we developed an evaluation framework to be utilized by model developers, data users, and other stakeholders. This framework can serve as a baseline to contextualize the quality, strengths, and limitations of using data produced with machine learning techniques for research purposes. A vast amount of real-world data, such as pathology reports and clinical notes, are captured as unstructured text in electronic health records (EHRs). However, this information is both difficult and costly to extract through human abstraction, especially when scaling to large datasets is needed. Fortunately, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques provide promising solutions for a variety of information extraction tasks such as identifying a group of patients who have a specific diagnosis, share common characteristics, or show progression of a disease. However, using these ML-extracted data for research still introduces unique challenges in assessing validity and generalizability to different cohorts of interest. In order to enable effective and accurate use of ML-extracted real-world data (RWD) to support research and real-world evidence generation, we propose a research-centric evaluation framework for model developers, ML-extracted data users and other RWD stakeholders. This framework covers the fundamentals of evaluating RWD produced using ML methods to maximize the use of EHR data for research purposes.},

The BiT model is based on transformer, and the others are based on CNN (Conventional Neural Network). Experiments have revealed that the STANet-PAM model generally performs the best in detecting the NCAs, and the STANet-PAM model can obtain more detailed information of land changes owing to its pyramid spatial-temporal attention module of multiple scales. At last, we have used the five models to analyze urbanization processes from 2015 to 2021 in the study area.

The combination of phenomics, deep learning, and machine learning represents a strong potential for the phenotypical investigation, leading the way to a more embracing approach, called machine learning phenomics (MLP). In particular, in this work we present a novel MLP platform for phenomics investigation of cancer-cells response to therapy, exploiting and combining the potential of time-lapse microscopy for cell behavior data acquisition and robust deep learning software architectures for the latent phenotypes extraction. A two-step proof of concepts is designed. First, we demonstrate a strict correlation among gene expression and cell phenotype with the aim to identify new biomarkers and targets for tailored therapy in human colorectal cancer onset and progression. Experiments were conducted on human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (DLD-1) and their profile was compared with an isogenic line in which the expression of LOX-1 transcript was knocked down. In addition, we also evaluate the phenotypic impact of the administration of different doses of an antineoplastic drug over DLD-1 cells.

We found that of the 10 ML regressors explored, the random forest regressor was the most effective LAI estimator, and it even outperformed the DNN regressor, with model efficiencies of 0.88 in Cheorwon and 0.82 in Paju. In addition, we demonstrated that it would be feasible to simulate the LAI using climate factors based on the integration of the ML and DNN regressors in a process-based crop model.

The support vector machine (SVM), passive aggressive classifier, and neural network (MLP) are applied in the context of divorce prediction. A question-based dataset is created by the field specialist. The responses to the questions provide important information about whether a marriage is likely to turn into divorce in the future. The cross-validation is applied in 5 folds, and the performance results of the evaluation metrics are examined. The accuracy score is 100\%, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve accuracy score, recall score, the precision score, and the F1 accuracy score are close to 97\% confidently.

RPTSVM considers a pair of non-convex non-smooth problems with chance constraints. To solve these difficult problems, a newly designed method based on the difference of convex functions (DC) programs approach is presented.

Materials and methods: The sewer network of Bogota wasthe case study for this work in which a dataset consisting of the characteristics of 5031 pipes inspected by CCTV (obtained by GIS) was considered, as well as information on external variables (e.g., age, sewerage, and road type). Probability density functions (PDF) were used to convert the scores given by failures found in CCTV into structural grades. In addition, three techniques were used to evaluate the predictions from different perspectives: positive likelihood rate (PLR), performance curve and deviation analysis. Results: it was found that: (i) SVM-based deterioration model used from its regression approach is suitable to predict critical structural conditions of uninspected sewer pipes because this model showed a PLR value around 6.8 (the highest value among the predictions of all structural conditions for both models) and 74â€‰\% of successful predictions for the first 100 pipes with the highest probability of being in critical conditions; and (ii) SVM-based deterioration model used from its classification approach is suitable to predict other structural conditions because this model showed homogeneous PLR values for the prediction of all structural conditions (PLR values between 1.67 and 3.88) and deviation analysis results for all structural conditions are lower than the ones for the SVM-based model from its regression approach.

For a support vector machine (SVM), a powerful binary classification tool, we proposed a novel efficient distributed sparse learning algorithm, the communication-efficient surrogate likelihood support vector machine (CSLSVM), in high-dimensions with convex or nonconvex penalties, based on a communication-efficient surrogate likelihood (CSL) framework. We extended the CSL for distributed SVMs without the need to smooth the hinge loss or the gradient of the loss. For a CSLSVM with lasso penalty, we proved that its estimator could achieve a near-oracle property for l 1 penalized SVM estimators on whole datasets. For a CSLSVM with smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty, we showed that its estimator enjoyed the oracle property, and that it used local linear approximation (LLA) to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, we showed that the LLA was guaranteed to converge to the oracle estimator, even in our distributed framework and the ultrahigh-dimensional setting, if an appropriate initial estimator was available. The proposed approach is highly competitive with the centralized method within a few rounds of communications. Numerical experiments provided supportive evidence.},

In the recent past, efforts to improve the reliability of LULC maps have seen a proliferation of image classification techniques. Despite these efforts, derived LULC maps are still often judged to be of insufficient quality for operational applications, due to disagreement between generated maps and reference data. In this study we sought to pursue two objectives: first, to test the new-generation multispectral RapidEye imagery classification output using machine-learning random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers in a heterogeneous coastal landscape; and second, to determine the importance of different RapidEye bands on classification output. Accuracy of the derived thematic maps was assessed by computing confusion matrices of the classifiers’ cover maps with respective independent validation data sets. An overall classification accuracy of 93.07\% with a kappa value of 0.92, and 91.80 with a kappa value of 0.92 was achieved using RF and SVM, respectively. In this study, RF and SVM classifiers performed comparatively similarly as demonstrated by the results of McNemer’s test (Z = 1.15). An evaluation of different RapidEye bands using the two classifiers showed that incorporation of the red-edge band has a significant effect on the overall classification accuracy in vegetation cover types. Consequently, pursuit of high classification accuracy using high-spatial resolution imagery on complex landscapes remains paramount.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Supervised classification algorithms are commonly used in the designing of computer-aided diagnosis systems. In this study, we present a resampling strategy based Random Forests (RF) ensemble classifier to improve diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia. Random forests is an ensemble classifier that consists of many decision trees and outputs the class that is the mode of the class''s output by individual trees. In this way, an RF ensemble classifier performs better than a single tree from classification performance point of view. In general, multiclass datasets having unbalanced distribution of sample sizes are difficult to analyze in terms of class discrimination. Cardiac arrhythmia is such a dataset that has multiple classes with small sample sizes and it is therefore adequate to test our resampling based training strategy. The dataset contains 452 samples in fourteen types of arrhythmias and eleven of these classes have sample sizes less than 15. Our diagnosis strategy consists of two parts: (i) a correlation based feature selection algorithm is used to select relevant features from cardiac arrhythmia dataset. (ii) RF machine learning algorithm is used to evaluate the performance of selected features with and without simple random sampling to evaluate the efficiency of proposed training strategy. The resultant accuracy of the classifier is found to be 90.0\% and this is a quite high diagnosis performance for cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, three case studies, i.e., thyroid, cardiotocography and audiology, are used to benchmark the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of experiments demonstrated the efficiency of random sampling strategy in training RF ensemble classification algorithm.},

Machine-vision-based tube measurement is characterized by its accuracy, level of automation, noncontact nature and reliability. However, it cannot classify tube structures automatically. Commercial systems and previous algorithms cannot measure branch tubes due to difficulties of classifying tube structures. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for classifying tube structures. Multiple shape descriptors are used to extract tube structure features. Furthermore, RF classifier is used to distinguish among tube structures after tube features extraction. For efficient and accurate classification, the relative importance of each feature is calculated. Compared to results of ResNet-18 training on tube structures dataset, the precision of proposed method achieves 94\% while the other is only 88\%; experiments shows good performance on Recall and F-score.

	abstract = {Abstract: Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning. In this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92\% overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20\%, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level.},

The balanced dataset is classified in the next step, using the tree-based ensemble classifiers by including the spectral and spatial features. Finally, the comparative study is performed based on the statistical analysis of the outcome obtained from those classifiers that are discussed in the results section. In addition, we applied a new ensemble hybrid classifier named random rotation forest to our dataset. Three benchmark hyperspectral datasets: Indian Pines, Salinas Valley, and Pavia University, are applied for performing the experiments. We have taken precision, recall, F score, Cohen kappa, and overall accuracy as assessment metrics to evaluate our model. The obtained result shows that SMOTE, Tomek Links, and their combinations stand out to be the more optimized resampling strategies.

Among various traditional biometric and physiological features, we include cognitive/brainwaves via electroencephalogram (EEG) which function as a unique performance indicator due to its reliable, flexible, and unique trait resulting in why it is hard for an un-authorized entity(ies) to breach the boundaries by stealing or mimicking them. Conventional security and privacy techniques in the medical domain are not the potential candidates to simultaneously provide both security and energy efficiency. Therefore, state-of-the art biometrics methods (i.e., machine learning, deep learning, etc.) their applications with novel solutions are investigated and recommended. The experimental setup considers EEG data analysis and interpretation of BCI. The key purpose of this setup is to reduce the number of electrodes and hence the computational power of the Random Forest (RF) classifier while testing EEG data.

For such applications, 3D data are usually acquired by LiDAR sensors resulting in a point cloud, which is a set of points characterized by its unstructured form and inherent sparsity. For the task of 3D semantic segmentation where the corresponding point clouds should be labeled with semantics, the current tendency is the use of deep learning neural network architectures for effective representation learning. On the other hand, various 2D and 3D computer vision tasks have used attention mechanisms which result in an effective re-weighting of the already learned features. In this work, we aim to investigate the role of attention mechanisms for the task of 3D semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, by identifying the significance of different attention mechanisms when adopted in existing deep learning networks. Our study is further supported by an extensive experimentation on two standard datasets for autonomous driving, namely Street3D and SemanticKITTI, that permit to draw conclusions at both a quantitative and qualitative level. Our experimental findings show that there is a clear advantage when attention mechanisms have been adopted, resulting in a superior performance. In particular, we show that the adoption of a Point Transformer in a SPVCNN network, results in an architecture which outperforms the state of the art on the Street3D dataset.
