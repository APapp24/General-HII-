brady group
sema_down'ing in while loop
buffer check
array size for setup stack
file lock in process.c

if they use palloc in setup_stack, should they have to check its return?

should fine grained locking around fd table access?



tara group:
wait_on_parent used to synch around load status since it uses same variable as exit status ; load status variable = exit status variable




for slack:
where should load status be stored? not in parent???

have regrades before revisions, students will use exam guide rather than solution for regrades.

regrades due monday, 5:30pm.
revisions due thursday, 5:30pm.

things to ask for next exam grading:
-can we form groups to grade specific problems

ah I see, I just think they shouldn't have to use one of their revise/resubmit 


batches: with small batch size, nn tries to fit to each one separately--best fit line bounces around a ton. bigger batch size means less frenetic bouncing, but too big size and overfitting--so 32-64-128 is good

adding batches, you might have to transpose the weight matrix to match shapes (input dotted with weights)

each layer is just weights and biases

softmax is: exponentiation of outputs to get rid of negative values, then normalization to get probability
-prior to exponentiation: subtract largest value of this layer

how wrong is the decision? use categorical cross entropy



get numbers on forbidden line spectra
watch out for star clusters vs galaxies vs hii



subscheme


gradient of higher pixel values
obvious

two perros 

extract

-see if arcseconds --> dimensions works
140pixels by 140pixels
gradient is only in x and y direction, which is ra and dec
vectors have to meet threshold before their directions are considered/intersections considered


preprocessing should: 
neural nets has finite dimensions: "high average"


categorize: 

2560 x 2560 pixel dimensions per unit (easily divisible), number/size of partitions decided by preprocessing

standard sizes of subunits decided by 

each pixel should have gradient, indication 


subunit size 



gradient because hii regions have slower gradients than faraway galaxies (which just look like bright points)
